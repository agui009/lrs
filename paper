ABSTRACT
This paper revisits the thorny issue of energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with the Ethereum blockchain, introducing the Ethereum network's strategic resolution for improving energy consumption and carbon footprint - the Merge. The main focus is transitioning from a Proof of Work (PoW) to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. From a theoretical standpoint, we dissect the feasibility of transitioning from PoW to PoS consensus algorithms in ameliorating energy efficiency and carbon emissions. Additionally, we have amassed and curated data from relevant research bodies about this issue. Both theoretical analyses and institutional data underscore that the trajectory Ethereum has embarked upon significantly mitigates energy consumption and carbon emissions.

1. INTRODUCTION
Blockchain technology is a powerful combination of Cryptography and distributed network, and has been applied to many fields. Ethereum is the most widely used blockchain system, and is proud of its leading position as the most popular blockchain system [1]. Its advent has magnetized a diverse range of developers, businesses, and community members, thereby engendering a vibrant and dynamic ecosystem. Data sourced from DappRadar affirms this, highlighting that as of October 2021, Ethereum supported over 3,000 active decentralized applications. These span many domains, including, but not limited to, DeFi, NFT, gaming, and social networking. On the cryptocurrency front, Ethereum maintains an unshakeable position, trailing only Bitcoin while constituting nearly a fifth of the entire cryptocurrency market.
However, the advent of blockchain technology has inherent challenges and predicaments. It grapples with the formidable dual specters of energy consumption and carbon emissions[2]. The incumbent PoW mechanism, typically employed for network security in blockchains, necessitates considerable computational power and electricity for competing for mining rewards. Consequently, the environmental toll exacted by blockchain technology has elicited societal and policy-level attention, often culminating in criticisms.
Addressing this critical challenge, the mavens behind Ethereum envisioned an evolutionary leap from the get-go: transitioning from the power-hungry PoW mechanism [3] to a more sustainable PoS mechanism [4]. Under this model, mining becomes an antiquated concept. Instead, node validators stake a commitment of 32 ETH to partake in the network consensus and reap corresponding rewards. This transition harbors the potential for improving the network's decentralization, speed, security, and scalability while curtailing energy consumption and carbon emissions.
This paper delves into the discourse surrounding Ethereum's transition towards greater energy efficiency and carbon neutrality. Initially, we will shed light on the environmental and energy pressures constricting Ethereum. Following this, we will unveil Ethereum's solution – the transition from PoW to PoS. In conclusion, we will scrutinize the impact of the PoS consensus on Ethereum's energy consumption and carbon emissions, drawing upon theoretical perspectives and real-world data. Our aspiration with this manuscript is to bestow insightful knowledge into Ethereum's energy efficiency transition and blockchain technology's broader role in sustainable development.
2. ETHEREUM'S ENERGY CONSUMPTION
The traditional bedrock of blockchain technology, the PoW consensus mechanism [5], is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it buttresses network security; on the other hand, it calls for substantial hardware processing prowess and electricity, which are essential to compete for mining rewards. Such a requirement culminates in a considerable environmental encumbrance, thrusting blockchain technology into the vortex of societal and policy-level scrutiny and censure.
PoW's environmental toll is not restricted to electricity consumption alone [6]. It also leaves an indelible carbon footprint, thereby exacerbating the global warming crisis. According to a report of CCRI, the annual carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions under the PoW regime for Ethereum approximated 11 million tons, mirroring Azerbaijan's annual carbon emissions. This disturbing trend casts a dark shadow over the environment, thus inciting grave concerns on a societal and policy level regarding blockchain technology's sustainability and long-term viability.
3. THE ETHEREUM MERGE: TRANSITION FROM POW TO POS
With an ambition to attenuate energy consumption and curb carbon emissions, the architects behind Ethereum have been envisioning a transition to a PoS mechanism from the outset. This fundamental change implies that the process of mining will be obsolete. However, node validators must stake a minimum of 32 ETH to participate in the network consensus and garner rewards.
3.1 Proof of Work (PoW)
The PoW consensus protocol, embraced by an array of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum in its nascent stages, predicates the validation of transactions and the addition of new blocks to the blockchain by unraveling intricate mathematical conundrums. The resolution of these problems demands a substantial allocation of computational power and time while verifying the solutions is relatively simple. This "work" forms the "proof," denoting nodes' need to illustrate significant computational resource investment in block creation.
In PoW, miners seek a value n, such that, for a given data D and function H, the result of H(D||n) fulfills a predetermined condition, such as the first k bits being zero. This relationship can be expressed as:
                                    (1)
However, the PoW protocol is riddled with dilemmas. Primary among these is its lamentable energy efficiency; the computation-heavy PoW guzzles excessive electricity. Furthermore, PoW could potentially instigate network centralization as nodes possessing superior computational prowess are more likely to secure block rewards.
3.2 Proof of Stake (PoS)
PoS offers an alternative consensus mechanism that validates transactions and generates new blocks fundamentally differently. Under a PoS system, the power to construct new blocks no longer hinges on the computational might of nodes but rather on the quantity of cryptocurrency they hold. Hence, nodes with more currency holdings are more likely to be selected to produce new blocks, thus significantly reducing energy consumption and somewhat thwarting network centralization.
In the PoS ecosystem, miners are determined by comparing the nodes' stakes with a randomly selected number. Should the stake Si of node i exceed the random number R, the node becomes eligible to be a candidate miner. This relationship can be expressed as:
                                           (2)
In the context of Ethereum's PoS, the condition mentioned above specifies a stake of 32 ETH, signifying that participants staking more than 32 ETH will emerge as candidate miners.
3.3 Ethereum's Evolution
Ethereum, in a bid to augment energy efficiency and resolve the intrinsic problems with PoW, resolved to pivot from PoW to PoS. This pivotal transition, known as "Ethereum 2.0" or "Ethereum Merge," [7] was implemented on September 15, 2022. Through this metamorphosis, Ethereum aims to accomplish superior energy efficiency, accelerated transaction confirmation times, and fortified network security. Upon completing the Merge, Ethereum will operate exclusively under the PoS mechanism. Table 1 compares PoS and PoW consensus algorithm.

4. IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND CARBON FOOTPRINT
4.1 Theoretical Analysis
The consensus mechanisms of blockchain, such as PoW and PoS, determine the network's energy consumption [8]. The Ethereum network under PoW requires a large amount of energy for competitive calculations by miner nodes. In contrast, the Ethereum network under PoS, through validator nodes that lock a certain number of tokens, changes the equipment threshold for miners from high-performance devices to ordinary computers, naturally reducing energy consumption. In PoW, all participants who want to win simultaneously participate in the challenging mining behavior, but in the end, only one person's labor is meaningful, which means that the energy consumption of other participants is meaningless. In PoS, participants who pledge ETH can execute block encapsulation in an agreed order. This certainty means that only one person needs to work in each round of block production, and others can be relatively silent, saving much energy.
Assuming there are n miners, and the computing power of each miner i is  , then the probability of miner i winning can be expressed as:
                                     (3)
However, for any miner i who has not won, their workload is wasted, which can be expressed as:
                                 (4)
Here,   represents the wasted computing power of the miner. Driven by interests, more and more participants increase their computing power, which means that j and   are becoming increasingly large, which also means that energy waste is is becoming increasingly large.
4.2 Energy Consumption Data Analysis
Some research institutions have performed on the energy consumption and carbon footprint of Ethereum, and the research of CBNSI [9], digiconomist [10], CCRI [11], and Kyle McDonald [12] is affirmed by the Ethereum official.

Figure 1. Estimated Annualised electricity consumption of the Ethereum network by CBNSI and digiconomist
Figure 1(a) shows the evaluation of the power consumption of the Ethereum network from May 20, 2017, to July 19, 2023, by CBNSI and digiconomist. Since the two institutions used different estimation models, there are differences in the estimated values simultaneously, but the trend is consistent. September 15, 2022, is the day of the Ethereum merger. The estimated values of the CBNSI and digiconomist models on September 14, 2022, are 21.9131TWh and 77.77421186TWh, and the estimated values on September 16 suddenly dropped to 0.0019653TWh and 0.01325377TWh. CBNSI and digiconomist estimated that the energy consumption of Ethereum on September 16, 2022, dropped by 99.99103% and 99.98296%, respectively, compared to September 14. Figure 1(b) shows that after the Ethereum merger, power consumption has remained at a reduced level.
4.3 Carbon Footprint Data Analysis
 
Figure 2. Estimated annualized emissions by Kyle McDonald
Carbon emissions are directly related to power consumption, but the geographical distribution of blockchain miners is also an important influencing factor. The energy sources available within a particular region also display a degree of variability. It is commonly accepted that developed nations are more likely to have a higher proportion of renewable energy sources compared to less developed nations, where coal is often the primary source of power generation. 
             (5)
Formula (5) reflects the direct relationship between carbon emissions and power consumption. Figure 2 shows that Ethereum's carbon emissions have risen significantly from 2015 to 2022. Unfortunately, Kyle McDonald did not evaluate the carbon emissions after the Ethereum merger. The Ethereum carbon emissions estimated by CCRI before and after the merger are 11016000T/year and 869.78T/year, respectively, and the merger has reduced carbon emissions by 99.9921%.
5. CONCLUSION
The Ethereum network's transition from PoW to PoS has significantly improved energy consumption and carbon emissions. The PoS method has significantly reduced the energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with the Ethereum network by eliminating the need for competitive computation among miners. The study outcomes highlight PoS's potential as a more sustainable and efficient consensus mechanism for blockchain networks. We will continue to monitor the long-term effects of this transition and look into new blockchain technology advances for environmental sustainability.
